# Dependency Analysis

## GORM and SQLite Integration

### Primary Dependencies
```
github.com/cloudygreybeard/contextmemory/cmd/cmctl → gorm.io/gorm@v1.25.7
github.com/glebarez/sqlite@v1.11.0 → gorm.io/gorm@v1.25.7
```

### SQLite Driver Chain
```
Our Code → GORM → glebarez/sqlite → modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go)
```

### Dependency Verification
From `go mod why github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`:
```
(main module does not need package github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
```

**Conclusion**: Our main module correctly uses the pure Go SQLite stack. The CGO-based `mattn/go-sqlite3` appears in the dependency graph as an indirect dependency of `modernc.org/sqlite` (likely for compatibility testing), but is not used in our build.

## WebAssembly Compatibility Confirmed

The pure Go dependency chain enables WebAssembly compilation:
- `gorm.io/gorm` - Pure Go ORM
- `github.com/glebarez/sqlite` - Pure Go GORM driver  
- `modernc.org/sqlite` - Pure Go SQLite implementation
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` - CGO-based (not used by our code)

## Architecture Validation

Our technical claims are accurate:
1. **GORM Integration**: We use GORM with a pure Go SQLite driver
2. **No CGO Dependencies**: Our main module has no direct CGO dependencies
3. **WebAssembly Compatible**: Successfully compiles to WASM
4. **Cross-Platform**: Single build process works across all target platforms

The documentation correctly reflects the implementation without overstating capabilities.
