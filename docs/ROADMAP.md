## Future Exploration (Post-v1.0)

### WebAssembly Integration
**Timeline**: Post-v1.0, pending dependency resolution

**Current Blocker**: `modernc.org/libc` dependency excludes `js/wasm` targets

**Potential Approaches**:
1. **Alternative SQLite Implementation**
   - Research WASM-native SQLite libraries
   - Evaluate performance vs. current pure Go implementation
   - Assess integration complexity with GORM

2. **Hybrid Architecture** 
   - Core memory operations in WebAssembly
   - SQLite operations via subprocess calls
   - Gradual migration path from current architecture

3. **Dependency Evolution Monitoring**
   - Track `modernc.org/libc` for potential WASM support
   - Monitor alternative pure Go SQLite implementations
   - Evaluate new WebAssembly-compatible database solutions

**Expected Benefits**:
- Zero-installation VS Code extension experience
- Reduced subprocess communication overhead  
- Single-package distribution model
- Direct in-process function calls

**Success Criteria**:
- Maintain full Cursor integration functionality
- Performance parity or improvement vs. subprocess calls
- Simplified deployment and distribution

### Cloud Storage Providers
**Timeline**: v1.1.0+

**Planned Providers**:
- AWS S3 with encryption
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage
- Self-hosted remote APIs

### Advanced AI Features
**Timeline**: v1.2.0+

**Potential Features**:
- Semantic similarity search
- Automatic memory summarization
- Smart memory recommendations
- Context-aware memory retrieval

### Enterprise Features
**Timeline**: v2.0.0+

**Potential Features**:
- Team memory sharing
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- SSO integration

## Contributing to the Roadmap

### Feedback Channels
- GitHub Issues for feature requests
- Discussions for architectural proposals
- Community feedback through VS Code marketplace

### Evaluation Criteria
- **User Impact**: How many users benefit?
- **Implementation Complexity**: Development effort required
- **Maintenance Burden**: Long-term support implications
- **Architecture Alignment**: Fits with current design principles

### Priority Framework
1. **P0**: Critical bugs, data loss prevention
2. **P1**: Core functionality improvements, major user experience issues
3. **P2**: Nice-to-have features, performance optimizations
4. **P3**: Experimental features, future exploration

This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback, technical discoveries, and evolving requirements.
