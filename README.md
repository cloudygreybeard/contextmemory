## Overview

ContextMemory transforms development conversations into a searchable knowledge base. Store session contexts, code snippets, and development notes with AI-assisted smart defaults.

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple storage options** - File-based (current), cloud storage (planned), remote APIs (planned)
- **Professional CLI** - `cmctl` with flexible output formats and verbosity controls
- **AI-assisted defaults** - Smart name and label generation  
- **Extensible architecture** - Provider system for different storage backends
- **Cross-platform** - Single Go binary for CLI operations
- **IDE integration** - VS Code extension for seamless workflow integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/cloudygreybeard/contextmemory.git
cd contextmemory
make build && make install.cli

# Basic usage
echo "Meeting notes..." | cmctl create --name "Sprint Planning" --labels "type=meeting,team=eng"
cmctl list
cmctl search --query "authentication" --labels "type=code"
cmctl get <memory-id>

# Advanced features
cmctl list --show-id              # Display memory IDs
cmctl list -o json                # JSON output for scripting
cmctl delete --labels "type=test" # Delete memories by criteria
cmctl search -q "auth" -o yaml    # Search with YAML output

# Provider options
cmctl --provider file health      # Local file storage (default)
cmctl --provider s3 health        # AWS S3 (coming soon)
cmctl --provider gcs health       # Google Cloud (coming soon)
```

## Architecture

**Production CLI (`cmctl`):**
- Go with Cobra framework for professional command-line experience
- Multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML, JSONPath, Go templates)
- Flexible verbosity controls (`-v` flag) and configuration options
- Cross-platform single binary, fast startup
- Extensible provider architecture (file, cloud, remote)

**TypeScript Components:**
- Core memory operations and AI assistant
- VS Code extension with tree view and command integration
- Legacy CLI for development/testing

**Storage Providers:**
- **File Provider**: Local filesystem storage (current, fully functional)
- **S3 Provider**: AWS S3 backend (planned)
- **GCS Provider**: Google Cloud Storage (planned)  
- **Remote Provider**: HTTP API backend (planned)

## CLI Reference

### Core Operations

```bash
# Create memories
echo "content" | cmctl create --name "Memory Name" --labels "key=value,type=note"
cmctl create --name "Code Review" --file "./notes.md" --labels "type=review,lang=go"

# List and search
cmctl list                                    # Show all memories
cmctl list --show-id                         # Include memory IDs
cmctl list --labels "type=meeting"           # Filter by labels
cmctl search --query "authentication"        # Full-text search
cmctl search --labels "type=code,lang=go"    # Search with label filters

# Retrieve and manage
cmctl get <memory-id>                         # Get specific memory
cmctl get <memory-id> -o json                # JSON output
cmctl delete <memory-id>                     # Delete specific memory
cmctl delete --labels "type=test"           # Delete by criteria
cmctl delete --all                          # Delete all memories
cmctl health                                 # Check system health
cmctl info                                   # Show storage info
```

### Output Formats

```bash
# Multiple output formats for scripting and data extraction
cmctl list -o json                          # JSON format
cmctl list -o yaml                          # YAML format
cmctl list -o jsonpath='{.items[*].name}'   # Extract specific fields
cmctl get mem_123 -o go-template='{{.spec.content}}'  # Custom templates

# Advanced JSONPath examples
cmctl list -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.labels.type=="test")].name}'  # Filter results
cmctl search -q "auth" -o jsonpath='{.items[*].id}'               # Get matching IDs
```

### Verbosity Controls

```bash
cmctl -v=0 list          # Quiet mode (essential output only)
cmctl -v=1 list          # Normal mode (default)
cmctl -v=2 list          # Verbose mode (debug info)
```

### Provider Selection

```bash
cmctl --provider file health      # Local file storage (default)
cmctl --provider s3 health        # AWS S3 (requires configuration)
cmctl --provider gcs health       # Google Cloud Storage
cmctl --provider remote health    # HTTP API backend
```

```bash
~/.contextmemory/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml     # Provider and CLI configuration

â””â”€â”€ index.json      # Search index and metadata
```
